# An Analysis of LinkedIn and Glassdoor Data

The objective of this project was to find information about employment in the tech sector, specifically the tenure of employment, and if this is related to career opportunities. It was also investigated if there are significant differences between female and male employees in terms of tenure and the number of positions/career opportunities within a company. The two datasets that were analysed both include, among others, information on five specific companies: Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook. This data derives from two different sources: LinkedIn and Glassdoor. The aim was to see, whether or not the findings of both independent datasets point into similar a direction.
